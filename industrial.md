### **Commonsense Reasoning Augmented App Recall**
- **Keywords**: Recommendation System, NLP, LLM, Graph.
- **Background**: Industrial implementation of academic research [**E-CARE: An Efficient LLM-based Commonsense-Augmented Framework for E-Commerce**](/research/#ecare) to efficiently enhance the app recall procedure with LLM-driven commonsense reasoning.
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Proposed a three-stage pipeline to distill domain commonsense from historical query-to-app interactions into a reasoning factor graph requiring no supervised fine-tuning or human annotation.
  - Developed a pipeline that recalls apps given reasoning factor graph with respect to commonsense behind the input query.
  - Offline evaluation showed that recall@5 improved by 11.1%, while precision@5 increased by 12.1%.
  - Online A/B testing demonstrated an 8.23% increase in Conversion Rate (CVR).

### **Unorthodox Fund Name Abbreviation Matching**
- **Keywords**: FinTech, NLP, Recommendation System
- **Background**: Various abbreviation criteria of fund names are used in the market, posing challenges for data aggregation.
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Developed recall and ranking pipeline with Elasticsearch and DSSM as recall and ranking models, respectively
  - Synthesized a large abbreviation-to-full name corpus for pre-training, followed by fine-tuning on the real corpus
  - Achieved 21% improvement in fund name recall compared to original word2vec cosine similarity

### **User Bonus Distribution with Causal Inference**
- **Keywords**: Causal Inference, Recommendation System, AB Testing, ROI Optimization
- **Background**: Specific users may be sensitive to monetary bonuses while others may not. This project aims to identify users who may be stimulated by bonuses using causal inference techniques to maximize potential gain.
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Applied causal forest model for robust performance in user bonus sensitivity detection
  - Designed random A/B testing on over 1 million users to collect user reactions to bonus changes
  - Proposed new split criterion for causal forest to address multi-target optimization problems
  - Used active days within the next 14 days as label to capture long-term dependency instead of next-day retention
- **Results**: 
  - 34% increase in retained users compared to random group in online A/B testing
  - 15% improvement in Return on Investment (ROI)
