### [**E-CARE: An Efficient LLM-based Commonsense-Augmented Framework for E-Commerce**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04087)
- **Authors**: **Ge Zhang**, RD Ajwani, T Zheng, H Gu, Y Hu, W Guo, M Coates, Y Zhang
- **Abstract**: We introduce E-CARE, a cost-efficient LLM-augmented framework that distills domain commonsense into a factor graph, enabling one LLM call per query for e-commerce relevance and retrieval. It yields up to 12.79% Macro F1 and 12.1% Recall@5 gains.
- **Status**: Under review for WWW 2026.
- **Key Contributions**: 
  - Distilled domain commonsense from historical query–product pairs into a reasoning factor graph.
  - Three-stage pipeline requiring no supervised fine-tuning or human annotation.
  - Consistent improvements in search relevance and app recall (up to 12.79% Macro F1, 12.1% Recall@5).

### [**Path-of-Thoughts: Robust Relational Reasoning with LLMs**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17963)
- **Authors**: **Ge Zhang**, MA Alomrani, H Gu, J Zhou, Y Hu, B Wang, Q Liu, M Coates, Y Zhang, J Hao
- **Abstract**: Path-of-Thoughts (PoT) decomposes relational reasoning into graph extraction, path identification, and reasoning, achieving up to 21.3% improvements on long-chain benchmarks with few LLM calls and improved robustness.
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Single-call prompting to extract task-agnostic graphs and queries.
  - Path identification over graphs to infer answers through multiple reasoning chains.
  - Strong performance on multiple kinship and spatial benchmarks

### [**Sparse Decomposition of Graph Neural Networks**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19723)
- **Authors**: Y Hu, M Zeng, **Ge Zhang**, P Rumiantsev, L Ma, Y Zhang, M Coates
- **Abstract**: We introduce a sparse decomposition framework that factorizes GNN hidden representations into a small set of basis components with sparse coefficients, improving interpretability and efficiency while retaining predictive performance.
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Formulated sparse factorization for GNN representations with an efficient optimization objective.
  - Provided analysis showing regularization and interpretability benefits without sacrificing expressivity.
  - Empirically demonstrated competitive accuracy with reduced complexity and clearer explanations across standard graph benchmarks.

### [**Enhancing Logical Reasoning in Large Language Models through Graph-based Synthetic Data**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12437)
- **Authors**: J Zhou, A Ghaddar, **Ge Zhang**, L Ma, Y Hu, S Pal, M Coates, B Wang
- **Abstract**: We generate graph-structured synthetic data that encodes compositional relations and reasoning chains, and use it to augment LLM training/evaluation, yielding consistent gains on multi-step logical reasoning without task-specific fine-tuning.
- **Key Contributions**:
  - Developed procedures to synthesize graph-grounded reasoning instances and prompts covering diverse logical patterns.
  - Data augmentation curriculum that injects compositional structure and longer reasoning chains.
  - Improved accuracy and robustness on multi-step reasoning benchmarks compared to strong baselines.
